# aeroponics-museum-exhibit

This project was a museum exhibit meant to teach children about aeroponics through the use of an interactive game. The game involved using buttons, dials and levers to maintain the health of various fake plants in space using "aeroponics". The results of the game, run by C code on an arduino board, were then piped over the serial port of a computer and processed by pythong code that displayed a GUI.
